1. I solved the autocomplete problem by first adding the words passed into the program by the file by recursively searching through the list and either adding a new node when one didn't exist for each character in that word or by increasing the size of the already existing node, if the node already had a child but the data for that node didn't match I created a sibling for that node. When passing in characters to search for a word in the dictionary i first add the character to the prefix and then check to see where in the Trie i am. If im somewhere in the middle of the list I go to the next child otherwise I check to see if it the first word. I then search through the list of siblings if currentNode's data is not equal to c. To find a predicition I created a new StringBuilder and advance until i find a child that is a word and return that and return the size of the currentNode for the number of predicitions.
One of the few things I ran into issues when coding and debugging was when I was trying to retreat back to a previous node as at some points the currentNode pointer would get out of sync with the length of the string and would cause weird things to happen with retrievePrediction and numberOfPredictions.

    *  the worst case of the boolean add method would be somewhere along the lines of O(alphabet size * word.length()) which could be when having to add a world where it would have to add a completely knew word with each letter in the word being completely knew in each positon of that word.
    * the worst case runtime for advance would be similar to that of add by being O(alphabet size) where it is advancing to a node that is the last sibling/ last child node that is a sibling.
    *  the worst case runtime for retreat would be the same as advance but in the opposite sense in that you are returning from a node that is at the end of a sibling list
    * reset, retrieveNumberofPredictionsworst case runtime is always O(1) as there is no searching or looping involved n either function
    * the worst case runtime of the void add method is the same as the worst case of the boolean add method
    * the worst case runtime of isWord is the same as reset in it being O(1) as there is no looping or searching involved
    * the worst case runtime of retrieveNumberofPredictions is also the same as isWord and reset for the same reason involved with there being no looping or searching being involved as it only needs to return a value depending on one of two cases
    * the worstcase runtime of retrievePrediction is O(prediction.length()) where there is only one possible solution for a letter and you are not currently pointing at the first letter of that word for example when the letter you enter is 'a' and the only possible answer is "abracadabra"
