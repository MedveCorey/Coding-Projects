        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Corey I am a Computer Science major at the University of Pittsburgh and am currently in my third year of school. I am creating this and other pages in the future
            as I believe it would be a good way to be able to practice using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, along with documenting the progress I make on things as I go. If you're reading this
            it may be because you are some sort of employer who I sent a link to the GitHub repository containing this and other code or maybe I published these who knows!
        </p>
        <h2>Day One Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Today I created three pages different HTML files:
            <ul>
                <li>"Index.html"</li>
                <li>"Blog.html"</li>
                <li>"DayOne.html" (This Page)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to one CSS file "Practice_style.css", and one JavaScript file "Practice.js"</p>
            I've also learned how to link the files together, add a navigation bar and other links between files. In addition to these I messed around with CSS a little bit.
        </p>
        <h2>Thoughts and Feelings</h2>
        <p>
            With today being my first day working with HTML in depth I feel very intrigued by it. It seems quite simple so far. The one issue I have so far with things is simply
            the look of the pages though I have learned from what I've been reading that CSS will allow me to control and customize things about the pages and I am looking forward
            to really learning how to use it.
